# Mentoring: Safe field training for any tech manager-to-be

So you have a goal of becoming a tech leader some day?

Does your company have a mentoring program?\
_Yes:_ great, start mentoring!\
_No:_ okay, start mentoring!

**Mentoring is an excellent way to learn about the most important management skills in a safe environment without all the risk & responsibility of being an actual supervisor.**

Mentoring can be official or unofficial. Many companies have an onboarding mentoring program where each new employee or summer intern is assigned an official mentor. In some companies the mentorship roles are assigned on a as-needed basis, e.g. between a senior and a junior engineer working on the same projects. Other companies lack an official mentoring program, but people still find themselves in the (unofficial) role of a mentor or mentee.

If your company doesn't have a mentoring program, think about whether it should and if you could be the one pushing the initiative. Nonetheless, a company doesn't need to have a mentoring program to have mentors and mentees. People fall into mentor roles naturally whilst working with employees they have something to teach to, and perhaps those kinds of naturally born mentor-mentee relationships are the most rewarding ones.

No matter what kind of a mentoring model your company has, **mentorship roles are great opportunities for both the mentee and the mentor.** The mentee gets a designated person who helps and supports him, and the mentor gets to see what is it like to have responsibility for another person. So go and find a junior employee you have something to teach to, and become their mentor!

## Mentoring 101

So now you find yourself in a (official or unofficial) mentor role? Congratulations! Let's dig into what you need to do to be a great mentor.

The **most important qualities of a great mentor** are quite simple, but sometimes very hard to right:

- **Reserve time for your mentee.**
- **Be there for them when they need your assistance.**
- **Listen to your mentee carefully.**

**Reserve time to sit down with your mentee at least a couple of times a week** and discuss anything that he or she wants to discuss and whatever you think is useful to discuss. Talk about the project your mentee is working on, talk about any problems they have been facing, and talk about how their day-to-day at the office has been. If your mentee is a programmer, go through tech details on a whiteboard or go through the code they have written.

**If your mentee asks for your assistance, try to find time as soon as possible to go through the problem.** Be always supportive and ready to help, or the mentee will get afraid of asking for help. Use collaboration tools, such as pair programming and code reviews to figure out a solution to the problem together.

**Listen to your mentee carefully, and communicate things clearly.** Listening is the most important skill of any manager, and a very valuable life skill in general. Most junior employees have a hard time communicating things directly, so you must carefully consider what your mentee is trying to say. Don't jump straight into solving a problem, but rather discuss things deeply and find solutions together. Encourage your mentee to be open about anything. Make sure your mentee understands that asking questions from any coworker is ok, and it is necessary to do to become better at the job.

Often it is a good idea to communicate clearly what you and the company expects from the mentee, especially if he or she is a new employee. For most new employees the expectations are very unclear, and this often causes a stressfull situation. Have a dicussion with your mentee at least a couple of times a month about what is expected of them and how they can best fulfill those expectations.
