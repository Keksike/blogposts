# Mentoring: Safe field training for any tech manager-to-be

So you have a goal of becoming a tech leader some day?

Does your company have a mentoring program?\
_Yes:_ great, start mentoring!\
_No:_ okay, start mentoring!

**Mentoring is an excellent way to learn the most important management skills in a safe environment and without all the risk & responsibility of being an actual supervisor.**

Mentoring can be official or unofficial. Many companies have an onboarding mentoring program where each new employee or summer intern is assigned an official mentor. In some companies the mentorship roles are assigned on a as-needed basis, e.g. between a senior and a junior engineer working on the same projects. Other companies lack an official mentoring program, but people still find themselves (unofficially) in the role of a mentor or mentee.

If your company doesn't have a mentoring program, think about whether it should and if you could be the one pushing the initiative. Nonetheless, a company doesn't need to have a mentoring program to have mentors and mentees. People fall into mentor roles naturally whilst working with employees they have something to teach to, and perhaps those kinds of naturally born mentor-mentee relationships are the most rewarding ones.

No matter what kind of a mentoring model your company has, **mentorship roles are great opportunities for both the mentee and the mentor.** The mentee gets a designated person who helps and supports him, and the mentor gets to see what is it like to have responsibility for another person. So go and find a junior employee you have something to teach to, and become their mentor!

## Mentoring 101

So now you find yourself in a (official or unofficial) mentor role? Congratulations! Let's dig into what you need to do to be a great mentor.

The **most important qualities of a great mentor** are quite simple, but sometimes very hard to do:

- **Reserve time for your mentee.**
- **Be there for them when they need your assistance.**
- **Listen carefully.**

Sit down with your mentee at least a couple of times a week and discuss anything that he or she wants to discuss and whatever you think is useful to discuss. Talk about the project your mentee is working on, talk about any problems they have been facing, and talk about how their day-to-day at the office has been. If your mentee is a programmer, go through tech details on a whiteboard or go through the code they have written.
